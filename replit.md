# TV ON Sistema de GestÃ£o

## Overview
TV ON is a comprehensive management system for TV/streaming services, designed for real-time communication and sophisticated media processing. It aims to streamline operations, enhance customer interaction, and provide robust management tools for service providers. The project focuses on intelligent, WhatsApp-like interactions and efficient handling of multimedia content.

## User Preferences
- **UI Simplification**: Remove unnecessary buttons from chat interface (no mute notifications or contact info buttons)

## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern UI.
- **UI Components**: Utilizes Shadcn/UI for modular and consistent UI elements.
- **State Management**: React Query for efficient server state management, supplemented by Context API for local state.
- **Routing**: Wouter is used for client-side routing.
- **Design Philosophy**: Focus on professional design with gradient backgrounds, modern icons, and color-coded sections for enhanced visual hierarchy and user experience. Consistent design system applied across pages (e.g., matching styling for Woovi and Config. TV pages).

### Backend
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, with Drizzle ORM for type-safe and efficient database interactions.
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket for bidirectional, real-time data exchange.
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Leverages the Baileys library for WhatsApp Web API integration.
- **Core Modules**:
    - **WhatsApp Bot System**: Intelligent keyword detection, enhanced visual menus (text-based due to WhatsApp button deprecation), improved response quality, and robust error handling. Supports multiple bot types (new clients, existing clients, test users) with dynamic variables.
    - **PIX Payment Management**: Comprehensive system for managing PIX payments, including configuration, test payment generation, transaction records, and webhook handling for payment confirmations and expirations. User-configurable PIX expiration times.
    - **Customer & Test Management**: Tools for managing clients and test accounts, including client status tracking, test duration management, and streamlined test creation/editing workflows with persistent system selection. Soft delete functionality for tests.
    - **Chat Interface**: Real-time WhatsApp chat integration with features like media message display (photos, videos, audio, documents, stickers), clickable phone numbers, and enhanced new chat functionality that creates conversations only upon first message sent.
    - **API Configuration**: Manages external API systems and redirect URLs, allowing unlimited system registrations.
    - **System Management**: Ability to manage individual "pontos" (service points) with associated values for total monthly revenue tracking.

### Key Technical Decisions
- **API Integration**: Direct integration with WhatsApp API for messaging and Woovi API for PIX payments.
- **Modular Design**: Separation of concerns with dedicated services for WhatsApp, PIX, and other functionalities.
- **Data Normalization**: Consistent phone number normalization for accurate client identification across the system.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling mechanisms, including user-friendly error messages and graceful handling of API timeouts.

## External Dependencies
- **WhatsApp API**: For real-time messaging and bot interactions (via Baileys library).
- **Woovi API**: For PIX payment generation, status updates, and webhook processing. âœ… Successfully integrated and tested
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for persistent data storage.
