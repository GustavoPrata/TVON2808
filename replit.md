# TV ON Sistema de GestÃ£o

## Overview
TV ON is a comprehensive management system for TV/streaming services, designed to streamline operations, enhance customer interaction, and provide robust management tools for service providers. It focuses on real-time communication, sophisticated media processing, intelligent WhatsApp-like interactions, and efficient multimedia content handling. The project aims to provide a robust platform for managing client interactions, payments, and service provisioning in the TV/streaming sector.

## User Preferences
- **UI Simplification**: Remove unnecessary buttons from chat interface (no mute notifications or contact info buttons)
- **Modern Tab Interface**: Use elegant tabbed layouts with gradient colors and icons for menu organization (similar to bot-config page style)
- **Data Management**: Systems data must come from local database, not external API

## Recent Changes
- **14/10/2025**: Critical WhatsApp connection issue - Error 405 from WhatsApp Web blocking all connection attempts. Updated Baileys to v6.7.20, implemented fresh session management, and attempted various browser identifiers. WhatsApp is persistently rejecting registration attempts across multiple server locations. Investigation ongoing.
- **13/10/2025 (v2)**: Fixed M3U upload HTML display bug. Server proxy now properly detects and converts HTML responses to JSON, preventing raw HTML/CSS code from appearing on screen after file upload. Improved error detection logic to correctly identify HTML error messages even with 200 status codes.
- **13/10/2025**: Added Gestor Defender quick access button in config-tv page. New indigo gradient button with Globe icon positioned left of "Carregar M3U" button, opens gestordefender.com in new tab for easy access to management platform.
- **11/10/2025 (v3)**: Updated WhatsApp bot trial duration from 24h to 6h. Changed all references in bot messages, menu options, PIX payment instructions, and backend calculations. Maintained 24h references for support availability only.
- **11/10/2025 (v2)**: Fixed critical Chrome extension infinite loop bug. Adjusted polling intervals from aggressive 1-3 seconds to conservative 60 seconds (active) and 5 minutes (idle). Implemented single-task control using activeTaskId, emergency reset system for stuck tasks (5-minute timeout), and improved flag management to prevent duplicate credential generation.
- **11/10/2025**: Implemented intelligent anti-spam system for WhatsApp bot. Adds 5-second delay for text messages to prevent multiple responses when clients send rapid messages. Menu navigation numbers (1, 2, 3, etc) and media messages (audio, images, videos) are processed immediately without delay, ensuring smooth user experience.
- **10/10/2025 (v5)**: Added unread message count badges to chat navigation tabs. Red circular badges display the number of unread messages for each category (Novos, Clientes, Testes), with real-time updates and "99+" limit for large counts. 
- **10/10/2025 (v4)**: Added external link buttons in test details modal to access streaming service websites (IBO Pro, IBO Player, Shamel) with proper new-tab behavior. Button displays next to application name in view mode only, with purple hover effect and "Acessar site" tooltip.
- **10/10/2025 (v3)**: Implemented persistent login sessions with PostgreSQL. Added connect-pg-simple for session storage, remember-me tokens with bcrypt hashing, auto-login on app reload, and critical security fix requiring SESSION_SECRET environment variable. Sessions and remember tokens now persist across server restarts.
- **10/10/2025**: Added M3U file upload functionality to config-tv page. Features include "Atualizar M3U" button in header that opens external att.php page in new tab, drag-and-drop area for uploading M3U files directly, backend proxy at `/api/m3u/upload` to handle CORS issues, and proper file input reset functionality allowing re-selection of same file.
- **08/10/2025**: Added manual task generation for Chrome extension offline scenarios. New endpoint `/api/office/automation/manual-task` and "Gerar Manual" button in painel-office allow users to add credential generation tasks manually when extension is not running. Tasks are queued in database and processed when extension reconnects.
- **26/09/2025**: Fixed critical bug where fixed systems (ID >= 1000) weren't appearing in distribution modal. Issue was caused by backend returning `systemId` (camelCase) while frontend expected `system_id` (snake_case). Solution: Added fallback support for both formats throughout the frontend.
- **25/09/2025 (v2)**: Refactored fixed systems to be REAL systems saved in database and API. Fixed systems now require username/password, use IDs >= 1000, and points are automatically calculated (total_points / num_systems). Removed manual point editing.
- **25/09/2025**: Added test message simulation feature in chat - allows sending messages as if from the client to test bot responses. Located above PIX billing option in chat sidebar.
- **24/09/2025**: Reversed synchronization direction - now pushes local database data TO the external API instead of pulling from it. The `/api/sync/systems` endpoint now sends local systems to the API, creating/updating/deleting as needed to make the API match the local database state.
